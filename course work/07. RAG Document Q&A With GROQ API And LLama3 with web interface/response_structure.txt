 'answer': 'Based on the provided context, the main challenges faced by modern LLMs are:\n\n1. Computational Cost: The need for extensive computational resources, which increases production costs and raises environmental concerns due to substantial energy consumption during large-scale training.\n2. Bias and Fairness: LLMs can inherit and amplify societal biases, which can lead to unfair outcomes and propagate biases in the data they are trained on.\n3. Continuous Learning: The continuous learning aspect of LLMs, which aims to have models that can adapt to new information over time, presents a fresh set of challenges, including technical intricacies and broader impact on real-world applications.'}
