Cricket – A Gentleman’s Game

Beneath the sun, on fields so wide,
Where willow meets the leather’s stride.
A game of grace, of skill and might,
Where dreams take flight in morning light.

The bowler steams with fire and pace,
A perfect line, a deadly chase.
The batsman stands, so calm, so tall,
Awaiting fate, to rise or fall.

A flick, a drive, a soaring six,
The crowd erupts, their hearts transfixed.
A diving catch, a stumping neat,
Moments that make the game complete.

The sound of cheers, the echoing roars,
The battle fought in runs and scores.
Through highs and lows, in sun or rain,
Cricket’s spirit will never wane.

For young and old, it weaves a spell,
A timeless tale, we know so well.
A game of honor, fierce yet fair,
With passion’s fire beyond compare.
